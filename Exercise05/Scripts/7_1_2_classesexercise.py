"""
EXERCISE:
1) Create a class for academic books you have read in your studies, which can
record various reference attributes (i.e. author name, year of publication,
title, publisher location and publisher name) as well as a string of the
variable name you're using for each entry.

NOTE: let's just stick with books as a publication format, and with single-
authored books at that. This just keeps things simple.

2) Within this class, create a class list which can store tuples of variable
name, author names and titles of each book you input, so you can keep a track
of all the things you read and keep a catalogue of which variables those
entries are stored under.

3) Create some entries - at least 5.

4) Build a method (i.e. a function) into the class for printing out references
in full Harvard format.

5) Find out (with relevant programming methods) how many entries are written by
a particularly favourite author.
